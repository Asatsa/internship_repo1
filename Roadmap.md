# General Vision

**Become a proficient, competent bioinformatician**
**Actively support genomic research in the environmental and agricultural fields while mentoring young environmental scientists to make use of the limitless potential of Bioinformatics**

## Internship vision
By the end of this internship, I would like to have an understanding of the Bioinformatics area of research. I see myself having basic bioinformatic skills that would alllow me pursue whatever  line of bioinformatics I choose.
