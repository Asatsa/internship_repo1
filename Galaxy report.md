##**1. Introduction**

*What is galaxy?*
Galaxy is a plattform

##**2. Introduction to galaxy and NGS**


##**3. Mapping**

*De novo* assembly
Assembly recipe
1. Find all overlaps between reads
2. Build a graph
3. simplify the graph
4. traverse the graph

*Tutorial*


##**5. Transcriptomics**

##**6. R in Galaxy**

Galaxy provide for a way to acces R studio from the plattform. This especialy comes handy when performing operations that do better in R such as data visualisation. In this course I worked on

##**7. introduction to single- cell RNAseq analysis**

##**8. Proteomics**

A proteome is the entire complement of proteins that can be expressed by a cell, tissue, or organism at a given time. These proteins are sequenced through mass-spectrometry which is a standard method for proteomic analysis. The method consits of thechniues such as; target proteomics,which measures a predefined set of proteins with accurate quantification; Mass spectrometry Imaging, which measures the location of proteins in thin tissue sections; shortgun/explorative proteomics which aims to identify as many proteins as posible in a sample. This is includes 2types Data depedent aquisions(DDA/DIA)
