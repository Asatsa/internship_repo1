## Description
I am currently undertaking a Bioinformatics internship at ICIPE. Where I hope to familiarize myself with core skills such as python and r programming and workflow languages too.I will also be able to learn project management and organization and most importantly collaboration through working with collegues and trainers on a mini-project. This is to ultimately make me a competive candidate for Msc. fellowships in Bioinformatics.

explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting!
