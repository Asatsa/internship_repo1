## Introduction

The internship at ICIPE has been an invaluable learning experience so far. These are the [milestones](https://github.com/Asatsa/internship_repo1/blob/main/Roadmap.md) I had set at the begining of the internship. You can find my progress [here](https://github.com/Asatsa/internship_repo1/issues/2)

### Git and github

Git for version control has been helpful in collaborations and just keeping track of work. I have learnt about creating and sharing projects. The practical part of using git i.e git pull and push is still lacking. I have found it difficult to resolve conflict from the terminal. This has led to a tendency of working from git hub like I am doing now  ðŸ˜…. This is to say that my comfort at working with git is still lacking.

### Training in Bash

This was the first programming language I learnt at ICIPE. I have learnt basic commands, navigation(directories), text editors, scripts looping e.t.c. This is are the training materials that I used with the help of an instructor[]. Furthermore I was engaged in a test just to enhance my bash understanding, you can find the quiz in this [repo](https://github.com/Asatsa/bash-quiz)
